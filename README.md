# Irrigation System

We built a watering system for plants like it was mentioned in the lecture.
The idea was to have a sensor for humidity and temperature in the ground near the plants.
We used this information, so we know when to water the plants.
If necessary, we activate a water pump to water the plants.
qWe implemented a web presentation for this data.
