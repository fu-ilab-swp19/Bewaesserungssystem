# Irrigation System

We built an irrigation system for plants. Therefor we have a sensor 
for humidity in the ground near the plants. We used this information, so we know when 
to water the plants. If necessary, we activate a water pump to water the plants.
Furthermore we sent our data (humidity and watered or not) via LoRa to The Things network and on to our website where
we visualize them.
